## Queries
- required for every GraphQL server
- side-effect free and are therefore parallelized by the execution engine.
- Only one query type can be registered using AddQueryType()
- If we want to split up our query type into multiple classes, we can do so using type extensions.
```
query {
  movies{
    title,
    description,
    superhero{
      name,
      superpowers{
        superPower,
      }
    }
  }
}
```
```
SELECT [m].[Title], CAST(1 AS bit), [s].[Name], [m].[Id], [s].[Id], [s0].[SuperPower], [s0].[Id]
    FROM [Movies] AS [m]
    INNER JOIN [Superheroes] AS [s] ON [m].[SuperheroId] = [s].[Id]
    LEFT JOIN [Superpowers] AS [s0] ON [s].[Id] = [s0].[SuperheroId]
    ORDER BY [m].[Id], [s].[Id]

```

## Mutations
- used to change data
- executed one by one
```
mutation {
  updateMovie(description: "fakeDesc12"){
    description
  }
}
```

## Subscriptions
- used to add real-time capabilities to our applications. 
- Clients can subscribe to events and receive the event data in real-time, as soon as the server publishes it.
```
subscription {
  movieAdded 
}

mutation {
  addMovieWithEvent(movie:"m2")
}
```

## Object Types

## Resolver
- A resolver is a generic function that fetches data from an arbitrary data source for a particular field.
- A resolver tree is a projection of a GraphQL operation that is prepared for execution.
```
query {
  me {
    name
    company {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}

```
![resolver-tree](./resolver-tree.PNG)
- This tree will be traversed by the execution engine, starting with one or more root resolvers. 
- Field resolvers that are subselections of a field, can only be executed after a value has been resolved for their parent field. In the case of the above example this means that the name and company resolvers can only run, after the me resolver has finished. Resolvers of field subselections can and will be executed in parallel.
- Hot Chocolate automatically converts properties with a public get accessor to a resolver that simply returns its value.
